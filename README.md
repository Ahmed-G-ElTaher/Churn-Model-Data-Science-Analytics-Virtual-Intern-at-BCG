## - First Task : Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
 ### Understanding the business context and problem statement.
#### * PowerCo. needs BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
#### * A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn.
#### * The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).
#### * i email the AD to erquest the data(Customer data,Churn data and Historical price data).

## - Second Task : Exploratory Data Analysis
 ### Understanding the business through data.
#### * After the AD send the data, i Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions.
#### * Try to verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn.
#### * Try to prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation
#### * After EDA, i found some conclusions : 
 - on average churned clients drives more gross and net margin 
 - consumption and forcasting between two groubs almost the same till 75% 
 - net margin will be a little bit higher than the current clients after 20% discount

## - Third Task : Feature Engineering & Modelling
 ### Uncovering signals within the data, predicting churn probability and evaluating model performance.

## - Forth Task : Findings & Recommendations
     Presenting your results and giving recommended actions to the client
